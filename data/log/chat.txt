Hey all, I'm chatter54, the tech support guy with a passion for all things digital. When it comes to managing stress, I find that a combination of tech solutions and old-fashioned relaxation techniques work best for me. For example, I use meditation apps to help me unwind after a tough day, and I make sure to get in some physical activity to clear my head. How about you, @all? What's your preferred method for decompressing from work-related stress?
